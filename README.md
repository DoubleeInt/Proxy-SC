## 👁️‍🗨️Proxy scraper & checker👁️‍🗨️

------

This is a fairly simple script that collects proxies from different sources and checks them for validity.

This script can work with HTTP, SOCKS4, SOCKS5 proxies.

```
- Asynchronous.
- Uses regex to search for proxies (ip:port format) on a web page, which allows you to pull out proxies even from json without making any changes to the code.
- Supports determining the geolocation of the proxy exit node.
- Can determine if a proxy is anonymous.
```
